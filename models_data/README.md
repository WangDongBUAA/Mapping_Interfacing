This presents the dataset of the three-dimensional models, including five different scenes. Each file has the raw point-cloud map, the filtered point-cloud map, the optimized mesh map, camera pose, and texture picture.
Since GitHub has a size limit on transmitting files, the rest files can be access at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hxzxzSPbJpOTnZHM1Z-PfMaUITThVFzt?usp=drive_link.
