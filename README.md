In this work, we propose a human-robot interaction framework based on three-dimensional mapping and virtual reality (VR) visualization. 

On the construction client, dense three-dimensional point-cloud maps are created based on the SLAM RTAB-Map algorithm with a Kinect-style depth camera. 

A data communication network is employed to transmit the optimized models to the VR-based exploration client. Utilizing VR visualization, the operator can gain an intuitive and comprehensive understanding of the environments to be explored. The three-dimensional agricultural scenes are mapped into VR models through the system, which can combine the physical worlds with the VR spaces in a better manner.

The main goal of the research is to improve the human-robot interaction in the mapping task by virtue of VR. We propose a system framework for humans to assist in creating three-dimensional agricultural maps on a mobile robot. Meanwhile, to enhance the immersive exploration experience, VR devices are utilized to provide intuitive interfaces between humans and robots.
